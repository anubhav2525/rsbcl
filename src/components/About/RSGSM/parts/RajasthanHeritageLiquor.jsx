                Since its formation, Rajasthan State Ganganagar Sugar Mills Limited
                (RSGSM) had molasses based distillery in SriGanganagar. On account of
                growing demand, Four More distilleries were acquired, one each at
                Ajmer (1957), Mandore (1957), Atru (1961) and Pratapgarh (1963). The
                distillery at Mandore was closed in May 1968 on account of sharabbandi
                movement and that at Pratapgarh was closed in March, 1973 being a
                small and uneconomic unit. Subsequently only the{" "}
                <strong>Jaipur State Distillery</strong> in Jhotwara, Jaipur, remained
                in work, since other than Rajasthan Heritage Liquor (RHL), all has
                shifted to Rectified Spirit (RS) or Extra Neutral Alcohol (ENA).
                However some of the original Pot stills and Vats, including wooden
                barrels are in the company, as its valuable asset.
